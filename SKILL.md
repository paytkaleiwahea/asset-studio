description: Find, populate and render existing Asset Studio templates through its local API, or create a reusable template when needed. Hand verified exports to separately connected editor tools. Use whenever someone asks for a poster, carousel slide, static graphic, stat card, quote card, video overlay, thumbnail, or any branded image or motion asset that should be reusable rather than one-off. Also use to add a new category, rebrand the studio, or diagnose a template that is not appearing.

# Asset Studio

Use an existing template when it fits. Create a new reusable template when the
design itself is new.

## Before anything else

Locate the studio. It is a checkout of the Asset Studio repo, identified by
`studio.config.json` and `generate.mjs` at its root. If the person has not said
where it is, ask once and remember it for the session. Never create a second
copy of the studio; there is one library and everything goes in it.

Read `TEMPLATE-GUIDE.md` from that checkout before writing your first template
in a session. It is the authoring contract and it changes per fork.

## Using existing templates

Read AGENT-WORKFLOW.md from the checkout. Connect to the running studio through its local HTTP API, inspect the manifest, pass field values to an export endpoint, and verify the returned local file. The connection requires local terminal/HTTP access; these instructions do not install an MCP or connect a cloud agent to localhost.

For Premiere or Resolve placement, use the separately connected editor tools and verify the timeline result. Do not create another template merely to populate an existing design. Keep render-input JSON with the editing project when it needs to be reused; export calls do not save browser drafts.

The authoring steps below apply only when a new or changed reusable design is needed.

## Creating a new template

A template, not a picture. The difference:

| Not this | This |
|---|---|
| One HTML file with the text baked in | A template with declared variables anyone can refill |
| Written to a temp folder or pasted in chat | Written to `templates/<media>/<category>/` |
| Described to the user | Built, verified in the manifest, and named back to them |

If you produce something the person cannot reopen and edit tomorrow from the
dashboard, you have not finished the task.

## Steps

**1. Decide media and category.**

Read `studio.config.json`. `media[]` gives the top-level types and their
folders, typically `statics`, `carousels`, and `video`. Pick the one that
matches the output. Then pick a category subfolder inside it. Reuse an existing
category when one fits. Creating a new folder adds a nav item automatically, so
make a new one when the asset genuinely starts a new group rather than forcing a
bad fit.

**2. Name it for reuse.**

Kebab-case, describing the form, not the campaign. `stat-counter.html` and
`quote-card.html` are right. `q4-webinar-promo.html` is wrong, because nobody
reuses it.

**3. Write the template.**

Follow the contract in `TEMPLATE-GUIDE.md`. The essentials:

- Declare every editable field in `data-composition-variables` on `<html>`.
  That JSON alone drives the editor UI. Types are `string`, `color`, `enum`.
- Give the root `data-composition-id`, `data-width="{{WIDTH}}"`,
  `data-height="{{HEIGHT}}"`, and `data-duration` (0 for stills, seconds for
  motion). The exporter screenshots this element, so it defines the frame.
- Use `{{WIDTH}}`, `{{HEIGHT}}`, and `{{LABEL}}`. Never hardcode canvas pixels;
  one template is stamped once per configured size.
- Target a specific ratio with `html[data-size="<suffix>"]` in CSS, using the
  suffixes from `sizes` in the config.
- Pull every color and font from the config brand block. Hardcoding brand values
  breaks the fork.

**4. Build it into the library.**

```bash
npm run build
```

This is not optional and it is the step most often skipped. Until it runs, the
template is invisible to the dashboard.

**5. Verify and report.**

Confirm the template's id appears in `build/manifest.json`. Then tell the person
the template name, the category it landed in, and that it is live at
`http://127.0.0.1:4800` (run `npm start` if the server is not up).

## Three traps

These are shipped bugs, not hypotheticals.

**Theme toggle silently dead.** Declared variables are written as inline styles
on `#root`, and inline styles beat class rules. So exposing `bgColor` or
`textColor` as variables on a themed template kills the `.dark` / `.light`
switch. Expose only `accentColor` and let the theme own the rest as custom
properties on `#root` and `#root.dark`.

**Runtime-parsed text getting clobbered.** The preview re-stamps every
`[data-var-text]` element after your inline script runs. If you split a variable
into child elements, they get overwritten with the raw string. Omit
`data-var-text` on those elements and read the value with
`window.__hyperframes?.getVariables?.() ?? window.__studio?.getVariables?.() ?? {}` instead.

**Invisible SVG.** `document.createElement("path")` makes an inert HTML element
that never paints. Use `document.createElementNS` with the SVG namespace. And
text inside a `clip-path` gets cropped, so keep the clipped shape and the text
in separate sibling elements.

## Useful patterns

- **Blank hides.** Remove an element when its variable is empty, so one template
  covers the with-caption and without-caption cases.
- **Auto-fit.** Measure the widest line against the container and scale the font
  down so long headlines never overflow.
- **One field, many lines.** Use a separator like `|` inside a single string
  variable so the person controls line breaks without extra fields.

## Rebranding

Everything brandable lives in `studio.config.json`: colors, fonts, output sizes,
nav taxonomy, and port. To rebrand, edit that file, then `npm run build`. Do not
hunt through templates for hardcoded values; if you find one, move it into the
config.

## Boundaries

Rendering is deterministic by design: HTML stamped into sizes, then screenshotted
or frame-rendered in headless Chrome. Same input, same output. Do not introduce
an image model into the render path.

Keep templates shipped with the repo generic. Client and personal creative
belongs in a private fork, not in the starter library.
