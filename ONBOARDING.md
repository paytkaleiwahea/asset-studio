# Onboarding

Two ways to set up your fork. Both end with a working, branded studio.

---

## Option A — the wizard (2 minutes)

```bash
npm install
npm run setup
```

It asks a handful of questions (name, handle, accent color, what you make, your categories),
then writes `studio.config.json`, creates your category folders, and drops a working template
into each so there's something on screen immediately.

```bash
npm start
```

---

## Option B — let an LLM do it

Better if you want it to *think* about your brand and category structure rather than you
guessing. Paste the prompt below into Claude, GPT, or Hermes. Answer its questions. It gives
you a JSON block. Then:

```bash
npm run setup -- --paste
```

Paste the JSON, type `END` on its own line, hit Enter.

### The prompt

> You are setting up my fork of **Asset Studio**, a local tool that turns HTML templates into
> branded social assets (PNG images and video overlays).
>
> **Interview me first.** Ask me, a few at a time, about:
> - what my brand/business is and who it's for
> - my brand name and the handle that should appear on assets
> - my colors (get a specific accent hex; if I only describe it, propose one)
> - what content I actually post — carousels? single images? short video?
> - the recurring *kinds* of posts I make (these become categories)
>
> Push back if my categories overlap or are too vague. I want 2–5 categories per media type,
> named as **lowercase-hyphenated** slugs describing the *job* of the asset (e.g. `proof`,
> `hot-takes`, `case-studies`) — not the visual style.
>
> When you have enough, output **only** a JSON block in exactly this shape:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "brand": {
>     "name": "My Studio",
>     "handle": "@myhandle",
>     "accent": "#2453FF",
>     "accentSoft": "#5C7CFF"
>   },
>   "media": [
>     { "id": "carousels", "label": "Carousels", "icon": "layers", "dir": "carousels",
>       "kind": "still", "blurb": "Multi-slide decks.",
>       "categories": ["slides", "covers"] },
>     { "id": "statics", "label": "Statics", "icon": "image", "dir": "statics",
>       "kind": "still", "blurb": "Single-frame posters.",
>       "categories": ["posters", "proof"] },
>     { "id": "video", "label": "Video", "icon": "play", "dir": "video",
>       "kind": "motion", "blurb": "Animated overlays.",
>       "categories": ["overlays"] }
>   ]
> }
> ```
>
> Rules:
> - `kind` is `"still"` (exports PNG) or `"motion"` (exports video). Only use `motion` if I said I make video.
> - `icon` is one of: `layers`, `image`, `play`.
> - `dir` must equal `id`.
> - Drop any media type I don't actually use.
> - `accent` must be a `#RRGGBB` hex with enough contrast to sit behind white text.
> - Output the JSON and nothing else — no commentary after it.

### Then keep going

The same assistant can write your templates. Paste it **TEMPLATE-GUIDE.md** and ask for a
template for one of your categories. Save the result to
`templates/<media>/<category>/<name>.html`, run `npm run build`, refresh.

That loop — *describe an asset → get a template → it lives in your library forever* — is the
whole point of this thing.

## What setup actually changes

| File | What happens |
|---|---|
| `studio.config.json` | Rewritten with your brand + media types |
| `templates/<media>/<category>/` | Folders created for every category you named |
| `templates/.../<name>.html` | A working starter copied into each new category |

Nothing else is touched. Re-run `npm run setup` any time to change your mind — it only adds
folders, it never deletes your templates.

## Changing things later

- **Rebrand**: edit `brand` in `studio.config.json`, then `npm run build`.
- **New category**: just make the folder. It appears in the nav on the next build.
- **New output size**: add to `sizes.still` or `sizes.motion` in the config.

Choosing not to keep starter examples sets `hideStarters` in the config. Original files remain available for future category seeding; no templates are deleted.

## Browser setup

First launch offers a skippable brand setup. Skipping opens the template library and is remembered in the config. Use Brand Settings from the library or editor anytime to return. Saving applies primary/secondary, background/text, heading/body fonts and the handle to connected starter defaults. CLI setup completion also dismisses the first-run invitation. Browser setup does not change your media categories.
